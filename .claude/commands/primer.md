# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the root directory and make sure to explore the latest Next.js frontend architecture and infrastructure state for the project.

Go into the backend project folder by doing "cd ../vrin-engine" where the backend of Vrin is deployed. Go through all the md files in the docs/ folder to understand the backend architecture and functioning in detail. Don't forget to read the CLAUDE.md file in the root of the vrin-engine project directory. Along with these important documentation read through also make sure to go through the important code files mentioned throughout all these docs within the vrin-engine project folder to get a thorough understanding of the backend architecture of Vrin.
