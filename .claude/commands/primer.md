# Prime Context for Claude Code

Use the command `tree` to get an understanding of the project structure.

Start with reading the CLAUDE.md file if it exists to get an understanding of the project.

Read key files in the root directory and make sure to explore the latest Next.js frontend architecture and infrastructure state for the project.

Explain back to me:
- Project structure
- Project purpose and goals
- Key files and their purposes
- Latest Next.js frontend architecture and infrastructure
